## Do the Activity: Communicating values using visual design
**Scenario:** You are building your own personal website / online portfolio and want to visually communicate your own unique values and brand identity. Please (a) complete the values activity and (b) use these values to create a "style tile."


### A. Values activity
Using this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vv5tPZ8UjqJNYO9pCp_PQhxHT8qoGY09deKX6uygUFA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">list of values</a>, select 5 that best describe the values that you want to communicate about yourself. Then narrow those down to 3 values (you don't want too many or you will dilute your main message).

### B. Create a style tile
Use this <a href="https://codepen.io/vanwars/pen/rNVjYBd?editors=1000" target="_blank">style guide template</a> (CodePen) to create your own style tile, instantiating the values that you selected above. Ideally, you will create at least two style tiles, but let's start with one. Based on the 3 final values you have chosen to convey from step 1, play around with colors, textures, fonts, etc. using the CodePen below to visually convey those values.
