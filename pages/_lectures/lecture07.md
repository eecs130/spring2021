Today will be our last day of CSS formal instruction, though you will still get a lot more practice in [HW2](../assignments/hw2). We will be doing a series of activities -- just so you can see what's possible. Try to have fun with these ideas. There's a lot of syntax, but perhaps these exercises will give you some ideas for your final project.
