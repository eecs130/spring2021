## Course Format
For the Monday and Wednesday class sessions, we will post, in advance (ideally), some slides, videos, coding activities, and / or readings that you will be expected to do on your own. Then, during the regularly scheduled class time, we will be discussing the concepts and ideas synchronously (i.e. live) on Zoom, doing Q&A, and doing activities. During Zoom lecture, we can go over anything you want, and I can do some live-coding activities and pause to make sure folks are getting their questions answered.

Today's readings provide interesting background and context for the web / internet. You're not going to be tested on them, but you should still do them in order to have a working knowledge of how the internet works. The readings shouldn't take too long!
