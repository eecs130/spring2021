Now that you have some experience with CSS Grid and Flexbox (from Homework 1), you are going to implement elements of the Spotify UI (as pictured below). This week, you will be implementing the look-and-feel of the website. In a future assigment, you will actually be programming the interactions / data queries using JavaScript in order to pull down actual songs, images, and text down from the Spotify servers (and play some music).

Please read the instructions carefully and complete the 5 steps below, using the starter files included in `hw02.zip`.

<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/homework/hw02/screen_1.png" target="_blank"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/homework/hw02/screen_1.png" /></a>

### A. Left Navigation
Complete the following tasks:

In the `index.html` file, add Font Awesome icons (Spotify logo, home, search, and headphones) within the "aside" tag (pictured below) in accordance with the screenshot. Note that the Font Awesome font reference is already included at the bottom of your `index.html` file. Your job is to search for relevant icons and include them. For instance, to get the Spotify icon, take a look <a href="https://fontawesome.com/icons/spotify?style=brands" target="_blank">here</a>.

Other than adding the icons, you shouldn't need to make any other changes to the HTML.

```html
<aside id="sidebar">
    <h1>
        <!--TODO: Font Awesome Icon Here -->
        Spotify
    </h1>
    <a href="#">
        <!--TODO: Font Awesome Icon Here -->
        Home
    </a>
    <a href="#">
        <!--TODO: Font Awesome Icon Here -->
        Search
    </a>
    <a class="selected" href="#">
        <!--TODO: Font Awesome Icon Here -->
        Your Library
    </a>
</aside>
```

In the `style.css` file, update the CSS to make the UI look like the screenshots (pictured above). This should be accomplished primarily by using flexbox properties and the box model (padding, margin, width, height, etc.). Be sure to put all of the CSS related to the left navigation in style.css.


### B. Header & Nav Styling
Next, you need to style the `header` and `nav` sections:
```html
<header>
    <a href="#" id="upgrade">Upgrade</a>
    <a href="#" id="profile">
        <i class="far fa-user"></i> Profile</a>
</header>
<nav>
    <a href="#">Playlists</a>
    <a href="#">Albums</a>
    <a class="selected" href="#">Artists</a>
</nav>
```

In the `style.css` file, add CSS style blocks to make the UI look like the screenshots (pictured above). Just as with Step #1, all alignment should be done using the box model (e.g. padding, margin, height, width) and with flexbox (e.g. flex-direction, justify-content, align-items).


### C. Artists Panel
Next, you need to style the `section` cards that represent each Spotify artist (pictured below):

```html
<article id="featured-content">
    <section class="artist-card">
        <div>
            <img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/62b33d12e2b9a033cf77585f6e3d4b2c6b3a63a1" />
            <h3>Taylor Swift</h3>
            <p>Artist</p>
            <span class="play-button"><i class="fas fa-play"></i></span>
        </div>
    </section>
    ...
</article>
```

In the `style.css` file, add CSS style blocks to make the UI look like the screenshots (pictured above). Again, all alignment should be done using the box model (e.g. padding, margin, height, width) and with flexbox (e.g. flex-direction, justify-content, align-items).

### D. Create Responsive UIs
Create the following responsive UIs shown below. If you're using more than 10-15 lines of code to achieve each of these effects, you're on the wrong track. Add the CSS to make these responsive UIs to `style.css`.

**Tablet:**  Use Flexbox to display albums 3-across.

<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/homework/hw02/screen_3.png" target="_blank"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/homework/hw02/screen_3.png" /></a>

**Mobile:**  Use Flexbox to display albums 2-across and hide the left menu.

<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/homework/hw02/screen_5.png" target="_blank"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/homework/hw02/screen_5.png" /></a>

### E. Hover Effects
Finally, implement the 4 hover effects shown in this video.

## What to turn in
To submit this week's homework assignment, copy your completed `hw02` folder into your repo folder. Then add, commit, and push all of your files to GitHub. Your commands should look something like this:

```shell
$ git add hw02
$ git commit -am "Checking in my hw02 folder"
$ git push
```

When you're done, paste a link to your hw02 GitHub pages on Canvas under the Homework 2 assignment.
