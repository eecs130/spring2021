During the last five weeks of the course, you will be designing and implementing a final project of your choosing. The parameters of the project are described in detail on the <a class="pj" href="/spring2021/project-description">project description page <i class="fas fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>.

## Your task
1. Carefully read the project description (linked to above).
2. Then fill out this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13GhdF06vjr5sPnlUkMXeWTpmGkVSZ3vFc81qr6fQeFQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">project proposal worksheet</a>. 

Take a look at the appendix (in the Google Doc) for some examples of how to fill the worksheet out, but try not to be too constrained by these examples. Feel free to make this project work for you and your goals.

## Rubric
Really, we just want to see that you put some time and effort into thinking about what you want to accomplish and what it might take to make it happen. Along these lines, we will be grading you on:

1. Completeness
2. Demonstrated attention and thought to the scope, nature, and breakdown of the tasks.
3. Evidence that you did some legwork to explore what kinds of examples, tutorials, and web resouces are out there.

## What to turn in
Please submit your completed planning worksheet as either a link to a copy of the Google Doc provided (make sure itâ€™s shared!) or as an uploaded file (e.g. Word Document).
