## Tutorial Sign-Ups

As described in the [syllabus](../syllabus/), this course involves weekly tutorial sessions where you will will work in smaller groups with a member of the teaching staff. Tutorials begin **this week**, and will be run synchronously (live) by your assigned peer mentors via Zoom. During each tutorial session, you will work through an exercise / series of exercises together with your peer mentor to advance your understanding of various web concepts. Tutorial sessions count for 15% of your grade and are a **MANDATORY** part of the class.

Please sign-up for a tutorial using <a class="lab" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1te8U_2eIa7GtWljit8C2yansXgDnPmP8zQL7Efo-1qI/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">this sign-up sheet <i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>. Please take a look at the first two tabs of the spreadsheet (towards the bottom) and sign up for one of the two times that best fits your schedule. If none of the listed times works for your schedule, please click the third tab and check all of the times that would work for your schedule (so that we can try to figure something out -- no guarantees).

## Pre-Course Questionnaire
In addition, if you haven't already done it, please fill out the <a class="lab" href="https://forms.gle/spbYystX2opXTqno6" target="_blank">pre-course questionnaire <i class="fa fa-link"></i></a>. This will help us to understand what time zones you all are in, and if you have any technological constraints that we should know about. We also wanted to know a bit about your background and what you hope to gain from the course!
