   * What is the overall goal of your project, and who are your users?
   * How did you use the various web technologies / web frameworks to create your app?
   * What you believe you should be evaluated on? Please pick from the list(s) in the rubric section below and/or suggest your own criteria? Bullets fine.
   * What were 1-2 things you learned in the process of completing your project?
   * Please provide a self-assessment: how do you think you did on this project given the assessment criteria you selected for yourself?
   * What would your next steps be if you had more time?

## Rubric & Evaluation
In evaluating your final project, the course staff and I will take the following into account (note that different criteria apply differently, depending on the direction of your project):

1. The time/effort you put into your project, and your intellectual curiosity
1. Your reflection of your own learning and possible next steps
1. Your instantiation of the design / coding / web architecture principles
1. Code proficiency / organization
