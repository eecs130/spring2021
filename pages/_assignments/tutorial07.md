In tutorial today, we will be going over more of [homework 4](../assignments/hw4) and answering questions. Please come with questions: because I (Sarah) went over part 1 in class, the expectation is that you do parts 2-3 on your own and ask questions as needed (versus us working through everything together). If you opt not to come to tutorial but still want to get credit for your attendance, please complete and upload parts 2&3 to canvas.
